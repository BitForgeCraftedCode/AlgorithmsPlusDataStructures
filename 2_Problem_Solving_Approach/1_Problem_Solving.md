# Problem Solving

* Understand the problem
* Explore concrete examples
* Break it down
* Solve/Simplify
* Look Back and Refactor

## Understand the problem

* Can I restate the problem in my own words?
* What are the inputs that go into the problem?
* What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
* Can the outputs be determined from the inputs in other words,<br/>
do I have enough information to sole the problem? (You may not be able to answer this question until you set about solving the problem.<br/>
That's okay; its's still worth considering.)
* How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

## Explore Concrete Examples

* Start with simple examples
* Progress to more complex examples
* Explore examples with empty inputs
* Explore examples with invalid inputs
